## HTML Validator

There's a free HTML validator, to check if your HTML code follows the standards. You can use this to check if your code is correct and uses the up-to-date standards, that should be used for modern web development.

There might be some errors that are not critical, as some of the new JavaScript solutions for effects, etc. don't work with standards. This can be ignored, if you know what it is.
