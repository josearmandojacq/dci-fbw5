# Description

This is an exercise for the [Bootstrap Framework 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/). You'll need to figure out how to use different features and components of the framework.

How to run the SCSS compiler on your terminal:

```bash
# Change to the directory of your exercise
cd ~/Development/exercises/016-bootstrap-framework/

# Run it once
node-sass scss --output css

# Watch for file changes
node-sass --watch scss --output css
```

# Tasks

1. Copy the folder **exercises/016-bootstrap-framework/exercise-001/template/** to your local exercise directory, that you use for development. This folder contains the needed code that is used to give you all needed tools as a template, including the SCSS version of Bootstrap.

1. Open a terminal, go to your newly created directory and run ```npm install``` once.

1. Create the following **navbar** and don't forget to change IDs to your own naming, as you should never copy code from the Bootstrap documentation without reading and modifying.:<br>![navbar](https://github.com/noreading/dci-fbw5/raw/master/exercises/016-bootstrap-framework/exercise-001/images/001-navbar.png)
